# API Course Structure for Non-Technical Professionals

## Target Audience
Non-technical professionals who want to understand APIs conceptually, particularly those working with:
- Low-code/no-code AI tools with GUI interfaces
- Applications that provide API access (like Vellum.ai)
- AI systems that can be extended through API integration

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
1. Explain what APIs are and why they're important in modern applications
2. Identify different types of APIs and their use cases
3. Understand how AI-specific APIs work and their capabilities
4. Recognize authentication methods and security considerations
5. Comprehend vector stores and their role in AI applications
6. Use templates to create basic API calls in Python
7. Integrate API calls into their existing workflows
